# Project-A.L.I.C.E: Artificial Limited Interface & Command Extension

## Overview
A.L.I.C.E stands for Artificial Limited Interface & Command Extension. A.L.I.C.E's main goal is to help you enjoy the game while giving you active feedback to improve your understanding of the game mechanics, your actions, and help you get out of those tight situations. It also provides a flexible sandbox for community development of commands, responses, and other game enriching experiences by providing the tools needed to regular players for building.

For those interested in contributing to the code, understand that this project was started by someone that knew nothing about coding when it began. If you would like to contribute do so with a open mind and don't be afraid to recommend a different/better method for coding something.
